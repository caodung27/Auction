# Auction

Auction is a website where users can buy and sell items. My aim with this Full Stack project was the design and development of an online auction platform, similar to eBay. The implementation follows a REST-api architecture and some of the key features are:

- **Secure Authorisation and Authentication**
- **Role-based Access Control**
- **Mail Client within the Application** 
- **Recommendations using Matrix Factorisation**

### Technologies
A Javascript stack was used for easier and faster deployment, comprised of **Express** and **Node.js** for the back-end, **MySQL** for the database and **React** for the front-end. A different relational database can also be used since the data modeling, associations and queries are handled with object-relational mapping using **Sequelize**.
